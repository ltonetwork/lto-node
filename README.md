## TestNet
 
If you wish to start testing with our testnet. Please create a wallet on: [https://testnet-wallet.lto.network](https://testnet-wallet.lto.network)
 
Request testnet tokens via our ["LTO Tech" telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/AJWQTUDKtDlsuGHVFb40eQ) channel.
 
To view all the transactions on the testnet you can check out our explorer on: [https://testnet-explorer.lto.network](https://testnet-explorer.lto.network)
 
## Mainnet
 
For mainnet you will have to buy tokens. You can then use these tokens by sending them to the wallet you will link to your node.
 
The wallet can be found here: [https://wallet.lto.network](https://wallet.lto.network)
